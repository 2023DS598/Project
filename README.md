# DS598 Final Project
This study aims to develop predictive models for mortality rates among critical care patients using a variety of machine learning methods, including neural networks, and utilizing large-scale healthcare data from the United States. While acknowledging the limitations of generalizing findings to other healthcare systems, we emphasize the significance of accurately predicting mortality rates for informed resource allocation and quality assessment in intensive care settings.

Traditional severity assessment standards in critical care, such as Apache scores, are widely used but have been reported to have low calibration for predicting mortality rates. For this reason, it is logical to create a new predictive model of mortality for patients in the intensive care unit that incorporates other predictors, including the Apache score. This project will compare the accuracy of prediction models using various classical machine learning methods and deep learning methods.
