# DS598 Final Project
This study aims to develop predictive models for mortality rates among critical care patients using neural networks, utilizing large-scale healthcare data from the United States. Additionally, we conduct a comparative analysis with classical machine learning techniques. While acknowledging the limitations of generalizing findings to other healthcare systems, we emphasize the significance of accurately predicting mortality rates for informed resource allocation and quality assessment in intensive care settings.

This repository contains the datasets used in the analysis, the python code, slides summarizing the project, and the final report.
