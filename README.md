# DS598 Final Project
This study aims to develop predictive models for mortality rates among critical care patients using varitety of machine with methods including neural networks, utilizing large-scale healthcare data from the United States. While acknowledging the limitations of generalizing findings to other healthcare systems, we emphasize the significance of accurately predicting mortality rates for informed resource allocation and quality assessment in intensive care settings.
